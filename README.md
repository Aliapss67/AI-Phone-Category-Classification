# Mobile Price Predictor

---

## Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to **predict smartphone prices** based on their technical specifications. By analyzing various hardware and feature parameters, the system aims to provide accurate price estimations, which can be useful for consumers, retailers, and market analysts.

## Key Features

* **Data Analysis & Preprocessing:** Utilizes `numpy` and `pandas` for efficient data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.
* **Machine Learning Model:** Implements **Logistic Regression** for the core prediction task. While Logistic Regression is typically a classification algorithm, it can be adapted for price prediction by categorizing prices into ranges (e.g., low, medium, high).
* **Model Evaluation:** Employs standard `sklearn.metrics` for assessing model performance, including confusion matrices.
* **Data Splitting:** Uses `train_test_split` to divide data into training and testing sets.
* **Cross-Validation:** Incorporates `KFold` and `StratifiedKFold` for robust model evaluation, ensuring reliability and generalization across different data subsets.
* **Visualization:** Leverages `matplotlib.pyplot` for data visualization and understanding model performance.

## Technologies & Libraries Used

* Python
* `numpy` (for numerical operations)
* `pandas` (for data manipulation and analysis)
* `matplotlib.pyplot` (for data visualization)
* `scikit-learn` (for machine learning functionalities, including `LogisticRegression`, `train_test_split`, `KFold`, `StratifiedKFold`, `metrics`, and `confusion_matrix`)

## Project Structure

The project typically resides within a single Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file, guiding through the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading:** Importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset containing phone specifications and prices.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial analysis to understand data distribution, relationships, and potential outliers.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
4.  **Feature Engineering (if applicable):** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model accuracy.
5.  **Model Training:** Training the Logistic Regression model on the preprocessed data.
6.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix) and cross-validation techniques.
7.  **Prediction:** Making predictions on new, unseen data.

## How to Run Locally

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Mobile-Price-Predictor.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Mobile-Price-Predictor.git)
    cd Mobile-Price-Predictor
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `YourGitHubUsername` with your actual GitHub username and adjust the repository name if it's different).*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to create a virtual environment first.
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
    *(You might also need `ipykernel` to run the Jupyter Notebook: `pip install ipykernel`)*

3.  **Obtain the dataset:**
    The dataset used for this project (containing mobile phone specifications and prices) is required. Place your `mobile_data.csv` (or whatever your dataset is named) file in the root directory of the cloned repository, or update the file path in the Jupyter Notebook accordingly.

4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the project's `.ipynb` file (e.g., `Mobile_Price_Prediction.ipynb`) and execute the cells sequentially.
